My name is Josemaria Macedo and I am a computer scientist looking to make a positive impact in my community through technology. I have a strong foundation in several programming languages, including Python, SQL/HQL, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, as well as experience with IDEs like Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ.
